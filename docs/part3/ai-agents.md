# Chapter 6: AI Agents as Your Junior Developer

> "AI is the new electricity." - Andrew Ng

<div class="content-box">

So far, you've created a clear product vision and technical specs (see [Chapter 5](/part3/starting-with-requirements)). Now it's time to turn ideas into working code—and the best part? You don't need to write every line yourself.

Instead, think of AI Agents like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Claude](https://anthropic.com/claude), [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), or [Bolt](https://bolt.ai) as your junior developers, ready to help with:

- ✅ Generating code for your tech stack
- ✅ Debugging and performance optimization
- ✅ Adding integrations (like payments, and analytics)
- ✅ Iterating through multiple product phases

Let's break down exactly how to work with AI Agents effectively.

</div>

## 1️⃣ Using AI Agents to Generate Code (Your Junior Developer on Call) 🚀

<div class="content-box">

Once your product & technical specs are ready, the first step is to translate those into an initial working codebase. AI can do this efficiently if prompted correctly.

### 📌 How to Prompt AI Agents to Write Code for You

#### ⚙️ Prompt Structure to Generate the First Version of Your App:
> Imagine you are a [Framework] and [Backend] developer. Build me a [describe your app] that [core functionality]. Below are the product and technical specifications:

📎 Attach the Product & Technical Spec (from Chapter 5).

Once AI generates the code:
- Test the initial setup
- Ask for adjustments if necessary
- Iterate step by step

</div>

## 2️⃣ AI-Powered Debugging & Troubleshooting 🔍

<div class="content-box">

AI is incredibly useful for real-time debugging, especially for new developers. But how you ask AI for help is crucial.

### 🔍 How to Ask AI to Debug Effectively

Instead of vague questions, give context, share code snippets, and explain the issue clearly.

#### 🚀 Example 1 – Fixing Firebase Authentication Issues

❌ **Bad Prompt**: My Firebase login isn't working. Help!

✅ **Good Prompt**:
> I'm using Firebase authentication with Next.js, and the sign-in function is not redirecting users after login. Here's my code snippet: [Paste code]. What's the issue, and how can I fix it?

#### 🚀 Example 2 – Optimizing API Performance

❌ **Bad Prompt**: My API is slow. What do I do?

✅ **Good Prompt**:
> I'm fetching user data from Supabase in my Next.js app, but the response time is slow. Here's my current query: [Paste query]. How can I optimize it for better performance?

👉 **Key**: Always share code context + clear explanations to get actionable answers.

</div>

## 3️⃣ Integrations: Adding Analytics, Payments, and Access Control with AI 🧩

<div class="content-box">

As you add features like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), [Stripe](https://stripe.com), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) Auth, or [RevenueCat](https://revenuecat.com), AI can guide you step-by-step, based on your stack.

### 🧩 3-Step Formula to Use AI for Integrations

1. ✅ **Step 1**: Ask ChatGPT to find the latest integration guide (e.g., "How to add Stripe to a Next.js app?")
2. ✅ **Step 2**: Ask how to implement this in your specific tech stack (e.g., Expo mobile app vs. Next.js)
3. ✅ **Step 3**: Use an AI agent like Cursor/Copilot to generate or adjust code following those steps

#### 💡 Example Prompt for Google Analytics
> Create product and technical requirements to add Google Analytics for this app: Frontend - React.js (v18.3.1), Vite (v5.4.2). About the app: {Add app description}.

AI will respond with:
- Code snippets
- Setup steps
- Configurations needed

💥 **Pro Tip**: You can use this same method for Stripe, Paddle, Firebase, Supabase, RevenueCat, Amplitude, and more!

## 4️⃣ Breaking Development into Phases (AI-Assisted Agile) ⚙️

<div class="content-box">

Trying to build everything at once is a recipe for burnout. Instead, split development into phases, and let AI handle each part one phase at a time.

### ⚙️ Suggested Development Phases

<div class="table-container">

| Phase | Key Features | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | The core functionality of your product | Ensure the main feature works. (e.g., Image sharing, AI resume generation) |
| Phase 2 | Additional screens & UI/UX | Add supporting screens like Profile, Settings |
| Phase 3 | Authentication & Access Control | Add login/signup with Firebase or Supabase |
| Phase 4 | Payments & Subscriptions | Add Stripe/RevenueCat once the product validated |
| Phase 5 | Performance Optimization | Speed up APIs, UI, and caching |
| Phase 6 | Advanced integrations & AI enhancements | Add analytics, automation, AI improvements |

</div>

### 💡 Why Phases Work:
- ✅ Reduces scope creep
- ✅ Helps in testing early and often
- ✅ Easier to iterate & pivot
- ✅ Focus on user feedback before scaling

</div>

## 5️⃣ Using GitHub for Version Control (Managed by You & AI) 📦

<div class="content-box">

Once AI helps generate code, version control using [GitHub](https://github.com) is essential for managing your project professionally.

### 📌 Step-by-Step to Push Code to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git**
```bash
git init
```

2. **Connect to Remote Repository**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

3. **Commit Initial Code**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - AI-generated codebase"
```

4. **Push Code to GitHub**
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. **(Optional)** Enable GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines, tests, and auto-deployment.

### 💡 Why Use GitHub?
- ✅ Tracks every change (AI-generated or manual)
- ✅ Enables collaboration (AI + Human)
- ✅ Essential for deployment (e.g., [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://netlify.com))
- ✅ Lets you revert mistakes easily

</div>

## 6️⃣ 🚀 How AI + Phases Help You Ship Faster

<div class="content-box">

- 🔹 Phase 1 alone = MVP – Test real users early
- 🔹 Each phase adds focused improvements – Avoid premature complexity
- 🔹 You can pivot early if user feedback is negative

### ⚙️ Example Real-Life AI Workflow Recap:

<div class="table-container">

| Task | Prompt to AI Agent | Outcome |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| Generate Resume Builder App | "Imagine you're a Next.js & Firebase developer..." | Full app codebase generated |
| Fix Firebase Auth Error | "Sign-in function not redirecting, here's code..." | Fixed code snippet & explanation |
| Add Stripe Subscriptions | "How to add Stripe to Next.js app with these specs..." | Stripe setup steps + code |
| Push Code to GitHub | "Show me commands to push code to GitHub..." | Full GitHub setup and commit guide |
