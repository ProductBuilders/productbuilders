# Using AI Coding Assistants as Your Junior Developer

> "AI is the new electricity." - Andrew Ng

<div class="content-box">

You have your product vision and technical specs (from [Chapter 5](/part3/starting-with-requirements)). Now, let's turn ideas into code with AI coding assistants. You don't need to write it all yourself!

Think of AI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Claude](https://anthropic.com/claude), [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), or [Bolt](https://bolt.ai) as your junior developers. They can help non-technical founders to:

- ✅ Generate code for your chosen tech stack.
- ✅ Debug errors and optimize app performance.
- ✅ Add integrations (payments, analytics, etc.).
- ✅ Iterate on your product through various development phases.

Let's explore how to effectively use these AI coding assistants.

</div>

## Generate Code with AI: Your AI Junior Developer 🚀

<div class="content-box">

> "Vibe coding with AI isn't just about writing code—it's about having a conversation with your tools, exploring possibilities, and letting creativity flow naturally." - Andrej Karpathy (adapted)

With your product and technical specifications ready, the first step is to generate the initial codebase. AI coding assistants can do this efficiently with the right prompts.

### Prompting AI Coding Assistants for App Code Generation

#### ⚙️ Prompt Structure for Initial App Code:
> As an expert [Framework] and [Backend] developer, build a [describe your app] that [core functionality]. Use the following product and technical specifications:

📎 Attach your Product & Technical Specifications (from Chapter 5).

After the AI generates the code:
- Test the initial application setup.
- Request adjustments if the output isn't perfect.
- Iterate on specific features step-by-step.

</div>

## AI-Powered Debugging: Fix Code with AI Assistants 🔍

<div class="content-box">

AI coding assistants are powerful tools for real-time debugging, especially if you're new to development or working with unfamiliar code.

### Effective Prompts for AI Code Debugging

Avoid vague questions. Provide context, share relevant code snippets, and clearly explain the problem you're encountering.

#### 🚀 Example 1: Fixing Firebase Authentication
❌ **Ineffective Prompt**: "My Firebase login isn't working. Help!"

✅ **Effective Prompt**:
> "I'm using Firebase authentication with Next.js. The sign-in function (pasted below) successfully authenticates the user but doesn't redirect to the dashboard page after login. Console shows no errors. What could be causing this, and how can I fix it? Code: [Paste relevant code snippet]"

#### 🚀 Example 2: Optimizing API Performance
❌ **Ineffective Prompt**: "My API is slow. How to make it faster?"

✅ **Effective Prompt**:
> "I'm fetching user data from Supabase in my Next.js app using the following query: [Paste query]. The API response time is over 2 seconds for about 100 records. How can I optimize this query or my data fetching strategy for better performance?"

👉 **Key for AI Debugging**: Provide specific code, describe the expected vs. actual behavior, and mention your tech stack.

</div>

## AI for Integrations: Analytics, Payments & More 🧩

<div class="content-box">

When adding features like [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com), [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payments, [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), or [RevenueCat](https://revenuecat.com) subscriptions, AI coding assistants can provide step-by-step guidance tailored to your app's tech stack.

### Using AI to Integrate Services like Stripe & Google Analytics

1. ✅ **Step 1: Research with AI**: Ask your AI assistant for the latest official integration guide. Example: "What's the official guide to add Stripe payments to a Next.js and Firebase app?"
2. ✅ **Step 2: Implementation Plan**: Ask the AI to outline the implementation steps for your specific tech stack. Example: "Outline the steps to integrate Stripe into my Expo mobile app using Node.js for the backend."
3. ✅ **Step 3: Code Generation & Adjustment**: Use an AI tool like Cursor or Copilot to generate the necessary code snippets or adjust existing code based on the integration steps.

#### 💡 Example AI Prompt for Google Analytics Integration:
> "Generate the product and technical requirements to add Google Analytics 4 to my web app. The frontend is built with React.js (v18.3.1) and Vite (v5.4.2). The app is a [brief app description]. Provide code examples for initialization and tracking page views."

AI will typically respond with:
- Required code snippets (e.g., for `index.html` or your main App component).
- Setup instructions (e.g., installing GA packages).
- Configuration details.

💥 **Pro Tip**: This method works well for integrating Stripe, Paddle, Firebase, Supabase, RevenueCat, Amplitude, and many other third-party services.

## AI-Assisted Agile: Phased App Development with AI Tools ⚙️

<div class="content-box">

Building an entire application in one go can be overwhelming. Instead, break down your app development into manageable phases. AI coding assistants can help you tackle each phase systematically.

### Structuring Your AI App Development in Phases

<div class="table-container">

| Phase | Key Features & Goals | Purpose & AI Application |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Phase 1: Core MVP | Implement the absolute core functionality. | AI generates foundational code (e.g., image sharing, AI resume builder). Focus on one key feature. |
| Phase 2: UI/UX & Supporting Screens | Develop additional screens (Profile, Settings, etc.) and refine user experience. | AI assists in creating UI components and navigation. |
| Phase 3: Authentication & Access | Integrate user login/signup (e.g., Firebase Auth, Supabase Auth). | AI helps implement secure authentication flows. |
| Phase 4: Monetization | Add payment gateways (Stripe, RevenueCat) if applicable. | AI guides through payment integration steps. Validate product before this. |
| Phase 5: Performance & Optimization | Optimize API calls, database queries, UI responsiveness, and implement caching. | AI helps identify bottlenecks and suggests optimization techniques. |
| Phase 6: Advanced Features & Integrations | Add analytics, advanced AI features, third-party services. | AI assists in complex integrations and feature enhancements. |

</div>

### 💡 Benefits of Phased Development with AI:
- ✅ **Reduces Scope Creep**: Focus on one set of features at a time.
- ✅ **Early Testing & Feedback**: Test core functionality with users sooner.
- ✅ **Iterative Improvement**: Easier to pivot or make changes based on feedback.
- ✅ **User-Focused Growth**: Scale features based on validated user needs.

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```
3.  **Stage and Commit Your Code**:
    Commit the initial AI-generated codebase or subsequent changes.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Initial AI-generated codebase for [feature]" 
    ```
    (Using Conventional Commits like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` is good practice)
4.  **Push Code to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main  # Ensure your main branch is called 'main'
    git push -u origin main
    ```
5.  **Continuous Integration/Deployment (Optional but Recommended)**:
    Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment to platforms like [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Netlify](https://netlify.com). AI can help generate basic CI/CD workflow files.

### 💡 Why GitHub is Essential for AI-Driven Development:
