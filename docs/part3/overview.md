# ðŸŸ  Part 3: Building Your Product

With your product idea and tech stack in place, it's time to bring your vision to life. This section will help you define your requirements, leverage AI agents for development, and deploy your product efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Chapter 5: Starting with the Requirements

A well-defined product specification is key to building successfully.

- âœ… **Define the problem** â€“ What are you solving, and for whom?
- âœ… **Create a high-level vision** â€“ What does success look like?
- âœ… **List user stories and use cases** â€“ What should users be able to do?
- âœ… **Outline technical requirements** â€“ What stack will you use? How will data flow?

## ðŸ¤– Chapter 6: AI Agents as Your Junior Developer

Instead of coding everything manually, use AI tools like Bolt, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Claude as your junior developers.

- âœ… **Generate code for your tech stack** â€“ With well-structured prompts
- âœ… **Debug and optimize** â€“ Use AI to troubleshoot issues efficiently
- âœ… **Break development into phases** â€“ Start with core functionality, then iterate
- âœ… **Ensure testability** â€“ Validate each phase before moving forward

By the end of Part 3, your product will be built and tested, setting the stage for deploying and launching publicly. ðŸš€
