# Chapter 4: Choosing Your Tech Stack (Non-Technical Guide)

> "Technology is best when it brings people together." - Matt Mullenweg, WordPress founder

Many low-code tools allow you to quickly build a proof of concept (POC), but they fall short when it comes to scalability, flexibility, and iteration speed.

If you're serious about building a product that can grow and evolve, you need to own your codebase—your secret sauce.

I know it can feel overwhelming if you have zero coding experience, but today's AI-powered coding tools (Lovable, Cursor, Bolt, Claude) make it easier than ever to write and deploy production-grade code.

🚀 **Goal**: Equip you with a simple, scalable tech stack and show you how to build it using AI tools—even if you're not a developer.

## 1️⃣ Understanding the Basics: Frontend, Backend & APIs

Before choosing a stack, you need to understand the three core components of any app:

### 🖥 Frontend (FE) – The User Interface
- This is what users see and interact with (buttons, forms, pages)
- **Example**: The Instagram app, a website's homepage

### 🖧 Backend (BE) – The Logic & Database
- This handles data processing, authentication, and business logic
- **Example**: When you log into Instagram, the backend checks your credentials

### 🔗 API – The Bridge Between FE & BE
- APIs allow different parts of your app to communicate and connect with external services
- **Example**: Instagram's API fetches your profile details from the backend when you open the app

## 2️⃣ Choosing the Right Tech Stack for Your MVP

### 📌 Recommended Stack for Different Product Types:

| Product Type | Frontend (UI) | Backend (Logic & Database) | APIs / Integrations | Hosting & DevOps |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Web-Based SaaS (B2B / B2C) | React (Next.js) / Vue.js | Supabase / Firebase | Stripe (Payments), OpenAI (AI) | Vercel / Render |
| Mobile App (iOS & Android) | Expo (React Native) | Firebase / Supabase | RevenueCat (Payments), PostHog (Analytics) | Expo Go |
| API-First Product | Minimal UI (if needed) | Node.js + Supabase | OpenAI, Claude, Replicate (AI APIs) | Railway / Render |
| Chrome Extension | Manifest V3 (React / Vanilla JS) | Firebase (if needed) | OpenAI (for AI features) | Chrome Web Store |

### 💡 Why This Stack?
- ✅ **Proven & Scalable** – Used by top startups
- ✅ **Fast Iteration** – Works well with AI tools for coding
- ✅ **Simple to Deploy** – No complex DevOps needed

## 3️⃣ Deep Dive into Each Tech Component

### 🖥 Frontend (User Interface & Experience)
- **React (Next.js)** – Best for web-based SaaS apps
- **Expo (React Native)** – Fastest way to build cross-platform mobile apps
- **Vue.js** – Alternative to React for web apps
- **Manifest V3** – For Chrome extensions

### 🖧 Backend (Logic & Database)
- **Next.js (Server Actions)** – Best for full-stack SaaS
- **Supabase** – Open-source Firebase alternative (PostgreSQL-based)
- **Firebase** – Google's managed backend (auth, database, storage)
- **Node.js + Express** – If you need custom backend logic

### 🔗 Payments & Subscriptions
- **Stripe** – For web-based SaaS & API products
- **RevenueCat** – For mobile app subscriptions (iOS & Android)

### 📊 Analytics & Tracking
- **PostHog** – Privacy-friendly product analytics

### 🧠 AI APIs & AI Features
- **OpenAI (GPT-4, DALL·E, Whisper)** – AI-generated content & chatbots
- **Claude (Anthropic)** – Alternative AI for text-based tasks
- **Replicate** – Deploy AI models via APIs

### ☁️ Hosting & DevOps (Deployment & Scalability)
- **Vercel** – Best for Next.js (auto-scaling)
- **Netlify** – Easy frontend hosting
- **Render / Railway** – Backend & database hosting

## 4️⃣ AI-Powered Coding: Build Faster with AI

The biggest challenge for non-technical founders is writing code—but AI tools have changed the game.

### 📌 Top AI Coding Assistants:
- ✔ **Cursor** – AI-powered IDE for coding in React, Next.js, Node.js
- ✔ **Bolt** – Auto-generates full-stack applications
- ✔ **Claude / ChatGPT** – Helps with code debugging & explanation

### 🎯 Action Step:
👉 Pick one of these tools and use it to write your first piece of code!

## 📌 Summary (TL;DR)
- ✅ Low-code tools are good for POCs but bad for scaling. Own your code
- ✅ AI coding tools (Cursor, Bolt, Claude) make coding easy—even if you're a beginner
- ✅ Choose a scalable tech stack: React / Expo (Frontend), Next.js / Firebase / Supabase (Backend), Stripe / RevenueCat (Payments)
- ✅ Use AI-powered tools to build your MVP faster
