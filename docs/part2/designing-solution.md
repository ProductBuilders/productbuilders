# Chapter 3: Designing Your Solution

> "Good design is obvious. Great design is transparent." - Joe Sparano

Once you've identified a problem worth solving and defined your first user persona, it's time to design your solution. This means mapping out the user journey, prioritizing features, and creating a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with the least effort.

🚀 **Goal**: Help you create a clear product blueprint using simple frameworks and AI tools—no design or technical skills required.

## 1️⃣ Your Solution Depends on Your Users (B2C vs. B2B)

Not all digital products are the same. Your user persona and business model dictate whether you build a B2C Mobile App, a B2B SaaS, or an API-first product.

### 📌 B2C (Business-to-Consumer) – Mobile App / Web App
- **Examples**: Social networks, fitness apps, personal finance apps
- **User Behavior**: Requires intuitive UI/UX, quick onboarding, virality, and retention hooks
- **Key Consideration**: Mobile-first approach, low friction to start

### 📌 B2B (Business-to-Business) – SaaS / API-first product
- **Example**: CRM tools, AI writing SaaS, workflow automation APIs
- **User Behavior**: Complex needs, decision-makers vs. end-users, sales-driven adoption
- **Key Consideration**: Clear ROI, integration with existing tools, pricing models

### 💡 Why This Matters?
Before sketching your idea, define:
- ✔ Who is your target user? (Individual consumers vs. business users)
- ✔ How will they use your product? (Mobile-first vs. desktop SaaS)
- ✔ Do they need an end-to-end platform or just an API?

## 2️⃣ Start with a Simple Sketch (No Design Skills Needed)

Many founders hesitate at this stage because they think they need fancy UI/UX design skills. You don't.

### 🛠 Tools You Can Use:
- ✔ Pen & Paper – Fastest way to sketch ideas
- ✔ Figma / Uizard – AI-powered wireframing tools for beginners
- ✔ Whimsical / Miro – Drag-and-drop tools for user flows

### 💡 Pro Tip:
The goal isn't pixel-perfect design. It's to visualize how your user moves through the product.

### 🎯 Action Step:
Take 5 minutes to draw:
- What does the first screen look like?
- What happens when the user takes an action (e.g., clicks a button)?
- If you prefer digital tools, Uizard can turn hand-drawn sketches into UI designs!

## 3️⃣ Map the User Journey (AI-Assisted)

Before building anything, define how your user interacts with the product.

### ✅ User Journey Mapping Framework – The 5 Es of UX
1. **Engage** – How does the user discover the product?
2. **Enter** – What's the onboarding/signup experience?
3. **Engage** – How does the user achieve their goal?
4. **Exit** – What happens when they complete the task?
5. **Extend** – What keeps them coming back?

### 🎯 Action Step: Use ChatGPT to Generate a User Flow
Try this prompt:
"I'm building an AI-based resume builder. Can you create a user journey from the landing page to the final resume download?"
AI will provide a first draft that you can refine.

## 4️⃣ Apply the Single Feature Rule

The biggest mistake founders make? Trying to build too much.

### 💡 The Single Feature Rule:
Focus on one core feature that delivers the main value.

- ✔ Dropbox MVP: A simple file-syncing demo video (not even an app)
- ✔ Instagram MVP: A basic app for sharing filtered photos (before adding stories, reels, etc.)

### 🚀 Example:
If you're building an AI writing tool, don't start with a full editor, grammar checker, and templates.
👉 Just launch an AI-powered "First Sentence Generator" and test demand.

### 🎯 Action Step: Ask yourself:
👉 "What is the ONE feature that solves my user's problem?"

## 5️⃣ Define Features Using MoSCoW Prioritization

Now that you have the core feature, break features into Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, and Won't-have (MoSCoW framework).

### Priority Level | Features
- **Must-have 🛠**: Core functionality that makes the product work (e.g., AI resume generation)
- **Should-have ✅**: Important but not critical (e.g., multiple resume templates)
- **Could-have 🤔**: Nice-to-have, adds extra value (e.g., AI-powered cover letter generator)
- **Won't-have (for now) 🚫**: Features that can wait (e.g., job-matching recommendations)

### 🎯 Action Step:
Make a MoSCoW list with just 3-5 core features.

## 6️⃣ Preparing for the MVP Phase

At this point, you should have:
- ✅ A sketch of your product idea
- ✅ A user journey map outlining key interactions
- ✅ A clear focus on your single most valuable feature
- ✅ A prioritized feature list using MoSCoW
- ✅ A decision on whether it's a B2C app, B2B SaaS, or API-first solution

### 💡 The next step? Bringing your idea to life with an MVP. But how do you build it?
- What tech stack should you choose?
- Can you use AI tools to build faster?

📌 That's exactly what we'll cover in Chapter 4: Choosing your tech stack. 🚀

## 📌 Summary (TL;DR)
- ✅ Define if your solution is a B2C Mobile App, a B2B SaaS, or an API
- ✅ Sketch your idea – No design skills are needed
- ✅ Use AI (ChatGPT, Uizard) for quick user journey maps & mockups
- ✅ Follow the Single Feature Rule – Start small & focus on one core value
- ✅ Prioritize with MoSCoW – Must-have vs. Nice-to-have
