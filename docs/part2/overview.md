# 🟡 Part 2: Planning Your Product

Now that you've identified a real problem and understand your target users, the next step is to plan your product effectively. This section will help you design a solution that is both functional and feasible while choosing the right tech stack, even if you're not technical.

## 🎨 Chapter 3: Designing Your Solution

Before jumping into development, it's important to visualize your product and define how it will work.

✅ Outline the core features – Focus on solving the primary user pain points.  
✅ Create wireframes or mockups – Use tools like Figma, Whimsical, or Balsamiq to design screens.  
✅ Map out user flows – Define how users interact with your product from start to finish.  
✅ Prioritize features into phases – Start with the core functionality and expand later.

## ⚙️ Chapter 4: Choosing Your Tech Stack (Non-Technical Guide)

Even if you're not a developer, picking the right tools and technologies will make building and scaling easier.

✅ Frontend – React / Vue for web apps, Expo for mobile, or Chrome Extension frameworks.  
✅ Backend – Next.js, Supabase, or Firebase for handling data and logic.  
✅ Payments – Stripe for web apps, RevenueCat for mobile apps.  
✅ Analytics – PostHog to track user engagement and behavior.  
✅ AI APIs – OpenAI, Claude, or Replicate for AI-powered features.  
✅ Hosting – Vercel, Render, or Netlify for easy deployment.

By the end of Part 2, you'll have a clear product blueprint and a tech stack that supports your vision, making the transition to development seamless. 🚀
