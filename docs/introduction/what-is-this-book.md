## Why This Book? 🤔

<div class="content-box">

Building a tech product can feel overwhelming in a world where technology is evolving rapidly—especially for non-technical founders. But the truth is, anyone can build a tech product with the right tools and approach.

This book is designed to demystify the process and show you how to go from a simple idea to a fully launched product using AI-powered tools that simplify development and make the process accessible to everyone.

But this isn't just a how-to guide—it's an open-source playbook for builders. My goal is to seed this book with my own stories and case studies, but I want your stories too. The best way to learn is through real experiences, and I hope this book becomes a collaborative, evolving resource where others contribute their journeys, insights, and lessons on building and scaling digital products.

## My Story 👋

<div class="author-box">

I'm [Angshuman Gupta](https://angshumangupta.com/), a product leader with 12+ years of experience in startups and multinational companies like [Zalando](https://www.zalando.com), [Zeta](https://www.zeta.tech), and [Ola](https://www.olacabs.com).

### My Products 🚀

- 🗣 **[German with Nik](https://germanwithnik.com/)** – A german language learning app providing German lessons through an AI tutor
- 📸 **[CaptionsGPT](https://captionsgpt.site/)** – An AI-powered mobile app that generates captions for photos & videos
- 🛡️ **[PII Shield](https://pii-shield.com)** – A document redaction tool powered by AI that automatically identifies and removes sensitive information *(Coming Soon)*
- 📚 **[PM Interview Prep](https://pminterviewprep.com)** – A comprehensive SaaS platform for product management interview preparation *(Coming Soon)*

Throughout my career, I've navigated the complexities of product development—from zero to one, scaling, and launching in competitive markets. I believe that with the right tools and mindset, anyone can turn their idea into a real product, even without being a coding expert.

This book is my way of sharing what I've learned, but I also want to learn from you.

</div>

## What You'll Learn 🎯

<div class="learning-objectives">

- ✅ Find & validate a product idea that solves real problems
- ✅ Design your product without a design background
- ✅ Use AI-powered coding tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Bolt, V0, Cursor, Claude) to build apps—even if you don't know how to code
- ✅ Launch, grow, and scale your product from MVP to revenue generation

Most importantly, this book will evolve. I want to open-source it so others can contribute their experiences, product-building stories, and practical insights. If you have a story to share—whether it's a success or a hard-earned lesson—I'd love for you to be part of this journey.

Let's build together. 🚀

## What is Product Builders? 🌍
Product Builders is an open-source community designed to guide founders, product managers and entrepreneurs through the process of building and launching digital products using AI-powered tools. In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, you no longer need to write code or hire expensive development teams to bring your ideas to life.

### The Philosophy of This Book
<div class="principles-grid">

Product Builders is built on a few core principles:

1. **Problem First, Solution Second**: The most successful products solve real problems. We'll focus heavily on identifying and validating problems before building solutions.

2. **User-Centered Development**: Understanding your users deeply is crucial for building products people actually want to use. We emphasize user research, feedback, and iterative development.

3. **Start Small, Iterate Quickly**: Rather than spending months building a perfect product, we advocate for launching minimal viable products (MVPs) and improving based on user feedback.

4. **Leverage AI Wisely**: AI tools can dramatically accelerate product development, but they're not magic. We'll show you how to use them effectively and understand their limitations.

5. **Community Knowledge**: Building products is a journey with common challenges. By sharing experiences and solutions, we all become better product builders.

## A Living Document 📖

<div class="content-box">

Product Builders is designed to evolve. As new tools emerge, as methodologies improve, and as contributors share their experiences, this book will grow and adapt.

In the spirit of product development itself, consider this the first version—the MVP—of a resource that will continually improve with community input.
