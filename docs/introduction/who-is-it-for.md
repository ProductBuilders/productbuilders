# Who Is This For?

This book is for:

- ✅ **Non-technical founders** who want to create custom web or mobile apps but feel intimidated by coding
- ✅ **Entrepreneurs & side hustlers** looking to launch digital products
- ✅ **Early-stage startup teams** who want to build fast without hiring a full engineering team

If you've ever thought, "I have a great idea, but I don't know how to build it," this book is for you.

## The Right Mindset

Building a product doesn't require a computer science degree or years of coding experience—it requires the right mindset:

1. **Start small and iterate**: Your first version should be simple
2. **Learn by doing**: The best way to learn is by building
3. **Embrace AI tools**: They can handle much of the technical complexity
4. **Focus on solving real problems**: Technology is just the means, not the end

## How to Use This Book

You can read this book from start to finish, or jump to specific sections that address your current challenges:

- If you're still searching for an idea, start with the **Identifying Problems** section
- If you have an idea but aren't sure how to build it, go to the **Building with AI** section
- If you're ready to launch, check out the **Launching** section

Each chapter contains practical advice, real examples, and actionable steps you can implement immediately.

## Non-Technical Founders & Entrepreneurs

You have a great product idea but don't have a technical background. Perhaps you've tried to:
- Find a technical co-founder (which can be as hard as finding a spouse!)
- Learn to code (but realized it would take too long)
- Hire developers (but found it expensive and difficult to manage)
- Use traditional no-code tools (but hit limitations)

This book provides a practical path forward using AI-powered tools that dramatically reduce the technical barriers to product creation.

## Domain Experts with Problem Insights

You deeply understand a specific industry or domain and have identified problems that need solving. You see opportunities that others might miss, but you lack the technical skills to build solutions yourself.

ProductBuilders will help you translate your domain expertise into working products without requiring you to become a technical expert.

## Solo Founders on a Budget

Building products traditionally requires significant capital for development. If you're bootstrapping or working with limited resources, this book will show you how to leverage AI tools to create professional products at a fraction of the traditional cost.

## "Non-Technical" Product Managers

You might work in a larger organization but lack the technical skills to prototype your ideas quickly. This book will help you create prototypes and MVPs without needing to involve engineering resources at early stages.

## Side-Project Creators

You want to build products on the side while maintaining your day job. The approaches in this book minimize the time and technical skills needed to turn your ideas into reality.

## What About Technical Readers?

If you already have technical skills, you'll still find value in:
- Learning how to leverage AI to accelerate your development process
- Understanding methodologies for problem validation and user research
- Exploring ways to build MVPs more quickly

## Prerequisites

While no technical background is required, you'll benefit most from this book if you have:

- **Curiosity and willingness to learn**: The tools are getting easier, but there's still a learning curve
- **A specific problem or idea**: Having a concrete goal will make applying the concepts easier
- **Persistence**: Building products, even with AI assistance, still requires effort and iteration

## What If I Don't Fit These Categories?

The beauty of an open-source book is that it can grow to address the needs of different readers. If you have perspectives or needs not covered here, consider [contributing](/contribute) to expand the book's scope.
