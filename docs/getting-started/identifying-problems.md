# Identifying Problems

## Finding Problems Worth Solving

One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make is building solutions without first validating that there's a real problem. As a non-technical founder, your advantage is that you can focus on deeply understanding problems before committing resources to build something.

### Key Questions to Ask

- What frustrations or pain points do people consistently experience?
- What workarounds are people currently using?
- How much time, money, or emotional energy does this problem cost people?
- How frequently do people encounter this problem?

### Problem Discovery Methods

#### 1. Personal Experience

Your own frustrations can be a gold mine for problem identification. If you've encountered a challenge multiple times, chances are others have too.

#### 2. User Interviews

Talking directly to potential users provides invaluable insights:

- Conduct open-ended interviews about their workflows or challenges
- Ask about their biggest frustrations in a specific domain
- Inquire about existing solutions they've tried and what's lacking

#### 3. Online Communities

Monitor relevant forums, social media groups, and communities where your target users gather:

- Reddit threads
- Facebook groups
- Industry-specific forums
- Twitter/X conversations

## Problem Validation

Not all problems are worth solving. Here's how to validate if a problem is worth your time:

### Validation Criteria

1. **Frequency**: How often do people encounter this problem?
2. **Intensity**: How painful or frustrating is the problem?
3. **Market Size**: How many people experience this problem?
4. **Willingness to Pay**: Would people pay for a solution?

### Validation Methods

1. **Surveys**: Quantify how widespread the problem is
2. **Problem Interviews**: Dive deeper into how people experience the problem
3. **Landing Page Tests**: Test if people sign up to hear about your solution

## Problem Statement Framework

Once you've identified a promising problem, articulate it clearly:

```
[User type] struggles with [specific challenge] when trying to [achieve goal], 
which makes them feel [emotion] and costs them [resources].
```

For example:
> Small business owners struggle with scheduling social media posts when trying to maintain a consistent online presence, which makes them feel overwhelmed and costs them several hours each week.

## Next Steps

Once you've identified and validated a problem, the next step is to deeply understand the users who experience it. This will help ensure your solution truly meets their needs.
