# Chapter 2: Understanding Your Users 👥

> "Get closer than ever to your customers. So close that you tell them what they need well before they realize it themselves." - Steve Jobs

::: tip Key Takeaway
Understanding your users deeply is crucial for building a successful product. This chapter will guide you through user research and the Micro-SaaS approach.

## Introduction: From Problem to People 🎯

<div class="content-box">

Once you've identified a problem worth solving, the next step is to deeply understand your users. Who are they? What motivates them? What solutions do they currently use (if any)?

If you're starting solo or as a small team, the best approach is Micro-SaaS—a focused, niche SaaS product solving a single, well-defined pain point for a specific user persona.

✔ Easier to launch and validate with limited resources  
✔ Clear target audience = better marketing & sales  
✔ Solving a pressing pain point → faster traction & first customers  
✔ Reduces competition by niching down  
✔ Once you get paying users, you can scale & expand (Product-Market Fit)

1️⃣ Define a Clear User Persona (B2C, B2B, Pro-Consumer)  
2️⃣ Find a Specific Pain Point That's Worth Solving
