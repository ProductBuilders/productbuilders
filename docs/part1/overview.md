# Ideation & Problem Discovery

Welcome to Part 1 of ProductBuilders, where we focus on the foundational stages of product development: identifying genuine problems and understanding your users.

## What You'll Learn in Part 1

This section will guide you through:

- **Finding Problems Worth Solving**: Learn how to identify genuine market needs and opportunities rather than creating solutions in search of problems.
  
- **Understanding Your Target Users**: Discover how to conduct effective user research to build products people actually want and need.

## Chapters in This Section

### [Chapter 1: Identifying a Problem Worth Solving](/part1/identifying-problems)
Discover frameworks and techniques to find genuine market needs that are worth addressing with your product.

### [Chapter 2: Understanding Your Users](/part1/understanding-users)
Learn how to effectively research, interview, and understand the people who will use your product.

## Why This Matters

Many products fail not because they're poorly built, but because they don't solve a real problem or don't understand user needs deeply enough. Getting these fundamentals right dramatically increases your chances of building a successful product.
