# PM Games: Building Interactive Games for Personal Website üéÆ

> "The best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to do is by playing." - Anonymous

<div class="content-box">

This case study explores how I built a suite of interactive games for my personal website (angshumangupta.com) to help product managers practice real-world skills through play. These games simulate scenarios like feature prioritization, metric matching, and team planning, providing engaging and educational experiences for PMs. I used Cursor as my AI coding assistant to generate and refine the components, dramatically speeding up development.

</div>

## üéØ Development Approach

<div class="content-box">

The development process followed a consistent pattern for each game:

1. **Idea Generation & Brainstorming:**
   - Used ChatGPT to brainstorm game concepts and mechanics
   - Generated initial feature lists and gameplay scenarios
   - Refined game ideas through iterative AI conversations

2. **Prompt Structure (For Cursor):**
   ```
   In my existing website built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, build me the game {game name}. The game does {game functionality}. Create them as separate files.
   ```

3. **Component Architecture:**
   - Each game was developed as an independent component
   - Seamless integration with existing React + Tailwind codebase
   - Consistent state management using React hooks

</div>

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

<div class="content-box">

- **AI Assistants:** 
  - Cursor for code generation and implementation
  - ChatGPT for brainstorming and idea generation
- **Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI

</div>

## üé≤ Game Portfolio

### 1. Quick Prioritization Game

<div class="content-box">

**URL:** [https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=prioritization](https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=prioritization)

**Purpose:**
- Simulate sprint planning exercise
- Select features based on value and effort
- Stay within fixed capacity

**Gameplay:**
- Players select features from a list with Value and Effort scores
- Capacity is capped with feedback when exceeded
- Players aim to maximize total Value without exceeding Effort

**Technical Features:**
- React component with useState hooks
- UI: Cards, Progress bar for capacity usage
- Final score display with close button

</div>

### 2. Feature-Metric Matcher

<div class="content-box">

**URL:** [https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=feature-metric](https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=feature-metric)

**Purpose:**
- Teach players to associate product initiatives with relevant success metrics

**Gameplay:**
- Drag and drop metrics onto features
- Real-time feedback for each match
- Final score shows performance

**Technical Features:**
- Drag-and-drop using react-beautiful-dnd
- State for matching, scoring, and feedback
- Two-column layout for clarity

</div>

### 3. Stack Challenge

<div class="content-box">

**URL:** [https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=stack-challenge](https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=stack-challenge)

**Purpose:**
- Help PMs think through basic tech stack decisions based on hypothetical projects

**Gameplay:**
- Player selects frontend, backend, and database options
- Based on choices, feedback is given (e.g., "Good choice", "Overkill")

**Technical Features:**
- Simple card/radio selection UI
- Predefined logic for feedback
- State for stack selections and scenario

</div>

### 4. Burnout Meter

<div class="content-box">

**URL:** [https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=burnout-meter](https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=burnout-meter)

**Purpose:**
- Balance sprint planning with team well-being

**Gameplay:**
- Choose tasks based on Effort and Impact
- Stay within capacity to avoid increasing burnout
- Play through 3 sprints, receive team feedback

**Technical Features:**
- State-managed sprints, burnout, and impact
- Visual indicators for burnout and sprint number
- Summary message at the end of game

</div>

### 5. PM vs Engineer Tic Tac Toe

<div class="content-box">

**URL:** [https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=tictactoe](https://angshumangupta.com/#/?game=tictactoe)

**Purpose:**
- Lighthearted take on PM-Engineer collaboration and conflict

**Gameplay:**
- Classic Tic Tac Toe with a twist: PM vs AI Engineer
- AI sometimes makes suboptimal moves (30% chance)
- Score tracked across rounds

**Technical Features:**
- Minimax algorithm with randomness
- React state for board, turns, winner, and score
- UI: Grid layout, icons, toast notifications

</div>
