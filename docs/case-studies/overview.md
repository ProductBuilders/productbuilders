## Why Case Studies Matter

Case studies provide context for applying the concepts you're learning in real-world scenarios. Each case study highlights:

- Lessons learned and mistakes made
- Key metrics and outcomes

These stories are meant to inspire you and provide practical insights that complement the more instructional content in the main chapters.
